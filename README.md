# Matrix Product States for Machine Learning
Everyone's favorite one-notebook minimal pytorch implementation of TensorNetwork for Machine Learning [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.06329) by Google.

Following the paper, we implement Matrix Product State (MPS) as a pytorch module and test it on MNIST. 

If you you liked this implementation you might check my [paper](https://journals.aps.org/prresearch/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevResearch.4.043111) inspired by this one.
